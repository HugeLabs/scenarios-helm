# for Validator to verify as success, the script needs to exit with code 0 (no error)
# and HAS to ONLY output "done". Every other text output will be taken as error.

# NOTE: there seems to be a limit after which the Validator verify command is not valid, even
# though exit code 0 and "done" is returned. This could be after X amount of commands, or too
# long execution time, not sure why. Hence this file should be as short as possible.

echo "done" # let Validator know success
